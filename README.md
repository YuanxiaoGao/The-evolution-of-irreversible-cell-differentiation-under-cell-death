This repository includes the codes, data, and other related materials for the work "The evolution of irreversible cell differentiation under cell death effect".

Overview

This repository contains the simulation materials of "The Evolution of irreversible cell differentiation under cell death effect" by Yuanxiao et al. The aim is to investigate an organism's reproductive rate under different stage-dependent cell differentiation strategies.

Organization

Code.

This folder includes the Python scripts for calculating the reproductive rates of organisms with different cell differentiation strategies under varying parameter spaces.

Data.

This folder stores data on each optimal dynamic cell differentiation strategy (an organism's reproductive rate under different parameter spaces). Since the data is large, we show the compressed data rather than the original data here.

Figure code.

This folder contains the Python scripts that read the relevant data stored in the folder data and generate corresponding figures.

Figures.

This folder contains the figures used in this work.

Usage

1. main_b_and_c.py is used to calculate an organism's reproductive rate and output the characteristics of the optimal strategy under varying parameter situations (in terms of the cell differentiation benefits b and differentiation costs c) and constants of the mortality rates of g cells and s cells (d_g and d_s)).

2. main_dgds.py is used to calculate an organism's reproductive rate and output the characteristics of the optimal strategy under varying parameter situations ( the mortality rates of g cells and s cells (d_g and d_s)) and constant of the cell differentiation benefits b and differentiation costs c.
). 
3. main_Bubble_chart.py is used to filter out all optimal ID strategies through loop statements, then calculate the average total cell count and germ-like cell ratio of all optimal ID strategies under each mortality rate, and take integers.
4. Figure 2A is generated from figure_survival range.py (in file code) by the data dgs_b1_c1 from the file data. 
5. Figure 2B is generated from figure_dgds.py (in file code) by the data of dgs_b1_c1 from the file data. 
6. Figure 2D is generated by figure_dgds_id.py and figure_dgds_son.py (in file code) respectively, by the data dgs_b1_c1_small from the file data. 
7. Figure 2C is generated from figures_fg and p1p2.py (in file code) by the data dgs_b1_c1_small from the file data. 
8. Figure 3 was generated by figure_b and c.py by the data of bc_dg0_ds0 (Figure 3A), bc_dg0.1_ds0 (Figure 3B), bc_dg0_ds0.1 (Figure 3C), bc_dg0.1_ds0.1 (Figure 3D), bc_dg0.2_ds0.2 (Figure 3E), and bc_dg0.3_ds0.3 (Figure 3F), respectively.
9. Figure 4 was generated by figure_A.py (Figure A), figure_B.py(Figure B), figure_C.py(Figure C), figure_D.py(Figure D), with data of Bubble_A, Bubble_B, Bubble_C, Bubble_D. respectively.
10. figure_app.py. generates the figures in the appendix.

All the codes were developed in Python 3.6.
